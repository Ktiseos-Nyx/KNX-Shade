# Re:Shade Presets by Duskfallcrew @ Ktiseos Nyx

## Update in October 2024:
Texture backgrounds can be used for ANY of the depth slice setups, but certain ones are formatted specifically, but most of them are only set to 1920x1080 as that's still a fairly standard sizing. 

## Update for 2025:

Moved the repo to my coding arm of Earth & Dusk for more clarity, if Azem or K'rhis make more (Dusk/earth) then we can put them in here as well as each other's XIV mod things.


## Works for Dawntrail

A collection of reshade presets that we've been working on. We're not perfect at them, and we're planning on learning more as time goes on.

You'll need ReShade installed: [Reshade](https://reshade.me/)

All shaders included were downloaded from Reshade, [and it's familiar shader repositories](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/ReShade#List_of_known_shader_repositories)

IF you'd like to donate: [![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/Z8Z8L4EO)

Includes shaders, so credit to every single one that I usedâ€¦ Credit is at the bottom, eventually I'll add download links. Textures are NOW included because Pirate Shaders had some with. Feel free to slap me if I'm missing anything.

The "OFF" one my be incorrectly rendered as I borrowed it without thinking from somewhere else. 

Lisc: Don't sell this for money, because I'd cry. Don't use this for anything toxic or against laws and regulations.

You CAN: Remix, redo and fix anything stupid I've done and re-name.
