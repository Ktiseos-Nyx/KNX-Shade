## üåü Features
*   A diverse collection of presets to suit various moods and environments.
*   Continuously updated and refined.
*   Designed with Final Fantasy XIV in mind, with confirmed compatibility for Dawntrail!

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
1.  **Final Fantasy XIV** (obviously! üòâ)
2.  **ReShade:** Download and install the latest version from [reshade.me](https://reshade.me/).
    *   During installation, select your FFXIV `ffxiv_dx11.exe` file.
    *   When prompted for shader packages, **it's highly recommended to select all standard shaders and any shader repositories you find interesting.** Our presets utilize a wide range of shaders. You can find a list of common shader repositories [here](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/ReShade#List_of_known_shader_repositories).

---

## üíæ Installation
1.  **Download Presets:**
    *   Click the green "Code" button on this repository page.
    *   Select "Download ZIP".
    *   Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a location of your choice.
2.  **Place Presets:**
    *   Copy the `.ini` preset files you want to use from the extracted folder.
    *   Paste them into your FFXIV game directory (where `ffxiv_dx11.exe` is located) or into a subfolder like `reshade-presets`. Some users also place them in `[FFXIV Game Folder]/game/reshade-shaders/Shaders/` - the key is that ReShade can find them.
3.  **Shader Files & Textures:**
    *   Our presets reference various shader files (`.fx`). These are downloaded when you select shader packages during ReShade installation. Ensure you have a comprehensive set!
    *   Some presets may also utilize textures (e.g., from Pirate Shaders). Where necessary, these textures are either included in this repository (check the folders!) or instructions will be provided.

---

## üéÆ How to Use
1.  Launch Final Fantasy XIV.
2.  Open the ReShade menu (usually by pressing the `Home` key).
3.  In the ReShade menu, you should see a dropdown list at the top. Click it to select your desired preset (`.ini` file).
4.  Experiment and enjoy!

> **A Note on the "OFF" Preset:** One preset is labeled "OFF". This was an experimental addition and may not render correctly for everyone. It's intended as a quick way to disable effects but use with caution.
