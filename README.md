## 🛠️ Getting Started: Installing ReShade
Before you can use our presets, you need to have ReShade installed and configured for Final Fantasy XIV.

1.  **Download ReShade:**
    *   Head to the official ReShade website: [reshade.me](https://reshade.me/)
    *   Download the latest version of the ReShade installer.

2.  **Run the ReShade Installer:**
    *   Execute the downloaded `ReShade_Setup_x.x.x.exe` file (the `x.x.x` will be the version number).
    *   A window will appear listing games or prompting you to browse. Click the large button that says **"Click here to select a game and manage its ReShade installation"**.
    *   Navigate to your Final Fantasy XIV game folder and select `ffxiv_dx11.exe`.
        *   *Common path: `C:\Program Files (x86)\SquareEnix\FINAL FANTASY XIV - A Realm Reborn\game\ffxiv_dx11.exe`*
    *   Click "Next".

3.  **Select Rendering API:**
    *   Choose **"Microsoft DirectX 10/11/12"** when prompted for the rendering API.
    *   Click "Next".

4.  **Shader Package Selection (Crucial Step!):**
    *   You'll be asked to select shader packages to install. Our presets utilize shaders from various common repositories.
    *   **Recommended:** For maximum compatibility and to ensure all our presets work out-of-the-box, **select all available shader packages**. This includes "Standard effects," "SweetFX by CeeJay.dk," "qUINT by Marty McFly," AstrayFX, OtisFX, and others that appear in the list.
    *   If you prefer a more minimal installation, ensure at least the following are checked (though you may encounter missing shaders with some presets):
        *   Standard effects
        *   SweetFX by CeeJay.dk
        *   qUINT by Marty McFly
    *   ReShade will then download the selected `.fx` shader files and `.fxh` header files.
    *   For a comprehensive list of known shader repositories that ReShade can pull from, see [this PCGamingWiki page](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/ReShade#List_of_known_shader_repositories). You can re-run the ReShade installer later to add more shader packages if needed.
    *   Click "Next" and then "Finish" once the downloads are complete.

5.  **Verify Installation:**
    *   Launch Final Fantasy XIV. You should see a ReShade overlay message at the top of your screen for a few seconds, indicating it has loaded successfully.
    *   You can open the ReShade menu in-game by pressing the `Home` key (this can be changed in ReShade settings).

## 💾 Installing Duskfallcrew's Presets
Once ReShade is set up:

1.  **Download Our Presets:**
    *   Click the green "Code" button on this GitHub repository page.
    *   Select "Download ZIP".
    *   Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a convenient location on your computer.

2.  **Place Preset Files:**
    *   Inside the extracted folder, you'll find our `.ini` preset files.
    *   Copy the `.ini` files you wish to use.
    *   Paste them into your FFXIV game directory (the same folder where `ffxiv_dx11.exe` is located).
        *   *Alternatively, you can create a subfolder like `reshade-presets` inside the game directory and place them there. ReShade allows you to navigate to different folders to find presets.*

3.  **Shader Files & Textures:**
    *   Our presets reference various shader files (`.fx`) that should have been downloaded during the ReShade shader package selection step. If a preset isn't working correctly, you might be missing a specific shader package. You can re-run the ReShade installer for `ffxiv_dx11.exe` and select additional shader packages to install.
    *   **Important Note on Shaders:** To the best of our knowledge, all shaders utilized by these presets are freely available from the standard ReShade repositories or their respective authors and **do not include any paid shaders.**
    *   Some presets may also utilize textures (e.g., for effects like LUTs or special overlays, often from shader packs like Pirate Shaders). Where necessary, these textures are either included directly in this repository (check the folders within the downloaded ZIP!) or specific instructions will be provided with the preset. Ensure texture paths in ReShade settings are correctly configured if needed (ReShade usually looks for a `reshade-shaders\Textures` folder within your game directory).

---

## 🎮 How to Use Presets In-Game
1.  Launch Final Fantasy XIV.
2.  Once in-game, open the ReShade menu (usually by pressing the `Home` key).
3.  At the top of the ReShade menu, you'll see a dropdown bar. Click it.
4.  Navigate to and select the desired `.ini` preset file from the list. The effects should apply immediately.
5.  Experiment and enjoy your newly beautified Eorzea!

> **A Note on the "OFF" Preset:** One preset is labeled "OFF". This was an experimental addition, potentially borrowed from elsewhere, and may not render correctly for everyone. It's intended as a quick way to disable effects but use with caution or consider simply unchecking active shaders in the ReShade menu.

## 📢 Updates & News

### October 2024 Update:
Texture backgrounds can be used for ANY of the depth slice setups. While certain ones are formatted specifically, most are designed for a 1920x1080 resolution, which remains a fairly standard sizing. Ensure textures are placed in the `reshade-shaders\Textures` folder within your FFXIV game directory for ReShade to find them.

### 2025 Update:
This repository has been moved to our coding arm, **Ktiseos Nyx**, for better organization and clarity. Future presets from Azem, K'rhis (Dusk/Earth), or other members may also be consolidated here and on our respective modding platform accounts. More presets have been added!
