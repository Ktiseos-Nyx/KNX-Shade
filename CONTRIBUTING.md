# Contributing

Due to the nature of Reshade presets, unless you're in Ktiseos Nyx or are Azem Soulcleaver or K'rhis Tia ...
We likely will not for this repository have any contributions.

Unless:

You have additions to our reshade presets, or have wallpaper submissions.

Aka:

You've edited a preset for clarity and don't want to claim it as a remix. 

Then you're able to pull a pull request! 

However, this does not mean right away it'll be accepted, it has to go through testing! 

If you'd like us to include or use your shader please contact us!
