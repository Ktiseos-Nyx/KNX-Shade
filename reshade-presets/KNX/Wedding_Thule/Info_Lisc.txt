Wedding Thule Reshade Preset by Duskfallcrew
———

Works for Dawntrail.
Includes shaders, so credit to every single one that I used…
Because lord knows it took me 3 hours to find where they all were.

This was created especially for pre-bonding ceremony pics me and my partner took in the Elpis Flowerbed at the end of Ultima Thule.
It works in MOST areas, though I warn you lighting tweaking may be required.

Ignore the crappy cloves on my bard, I for one abhor my bard and can’t stand it lol. 

I’m happy to keep working to improve this one, it’s my. Best one yet.

Lisc: Don't sell this for money, because I'd cry. Don't use this for anything toxic or against laws and regulations.

You CAN: Remix, redo and fix anything stupid I've done and re-name.

:) all I did was make a new one and went from whatever shaders I had!
