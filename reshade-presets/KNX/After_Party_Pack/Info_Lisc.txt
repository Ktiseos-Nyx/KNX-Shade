After Party Preset Pack
---
Does not include shaders, this is because most of my presets. That I've shared already have similar shaders.
I am also attempting to work on my own shader, even tho I suck at coding.

Warning: images should MOSTLY represent what's in the pack, I neglected to track what presets  I was using during our after party. 

I might even have a YouTube video sharing some of these at some stage. 

Usual Credit to all of the shaders I've used even though they're not included.

(Aka: if you got this, and you're missing shaders, download the ones from the wiki -- like most of them, I don't have all of them installed but most of my packs should have what's listed on the re-shade wiki) 

I will keep these free, they're just mostly presets using aesthetic ideas. 

However, if you're on Goblin/Crystal and want shaded/preset photos taken, feel free to get ahold of me via my discord: https://discord.gg/5t2kYxt7An
