If you like what I do? Please feel free to donate, not because making presets costs money, but because then you take care of my XIV sub and my partner's glam addiction.

Lisc: Don't sell this for money, because I'd cry. Don't use this for anything toxic or against laws and regulations.

You CAN: Remix, redo and fix anything stupid I've done and re-name.
