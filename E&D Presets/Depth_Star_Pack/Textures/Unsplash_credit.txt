Some pictures are from a wallpaper place, and are linked elsewhere - and Texturelabs for the photo textures I haven't figured out how to use yet.

My presets are *NEVER* for re-sale, so please do not take the crediting file away from this if you're re-making any of my presets to suit yourself.  I'm not taking the credit FOR EDITING or adding gradients, I'm just saying do NOT take credit for the images :) 

The only time you'll see "DO NOT RE-NAME OR CLAIM AS OWN " etc in a different matter is if I use my own photography for this.

To use these you'll need to rename them where needed to "STAGE" - one at a time, and do re-name your old one so you don't lose it. Unless I'm stupid and there's another way to do this.
